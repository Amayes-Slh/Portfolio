      "In a team of two, we embarked on Project Astar, where we implemented the A* pathfinding algorithm in Python. Our primary objective was to enable our robot to analyze and navigate the most efficient path, especially in a dynamic environment where obstacles rapidly changed positions. The project's central aim was to develop an algorithm for guiding the robot's movements. Our tasks included implementing the A* algorithm, incorporating Lidar data for position retrieval, and establishing SSH connections to the robot's system (Raspberry Pi) to enhance obstacle detection. We also adapted and transmitted data to facilitate the robot's autonomous movement, using matrices to relay the path. Rigorous testing ensued, focusing on optimizing the robot's speed, culminating in a final demonstration of its capabilities. This collaborative effort underscored our expertise in algorithm development and real-time robotics applications",
